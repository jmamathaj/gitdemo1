The national flag of India, colloquially called Tiraṅgā (the tricolour),
 is a horizontal rectangular tricolour flag, the colours being of India saffron,
 white and India green; with the Ashoka Chakra, a 24-spoke wheel,
 in navy blue at its centre.[1][2] It was adopted in its present form during
 a meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, and it became
 the official flag of the Union of India on 15 August 1947.
 The flag was subsequently retained as that of the Republic of India. In India, 
the term "tricolour" almost always refers to the Indian national flag.
